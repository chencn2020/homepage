excerpt: 'Due to the subjective nature of image quality assessment (IQA), assessing which image has better quality among a sequence of images is more reliable than assigning an absolute mean opinion score for an image.

# Abstract 

Image quality assessment (IQA) is a subjective task, resulting in considerable variances in ground truth labels. For this reason, it is more reasonable to evaluate IQA models using sequence correlation consistency metrics like PLCC and SROCC, rather than distance-based metrics such as MAE and MSE. However, due to the non-differentiable ranking function used in SROCC, existing methods often resort to the distance-based loss for training, leading to a gap between the training and evaluation goals. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for no-reference IQA to address this problem from both the aspects of loss function and network architecture. Specifically, we develop a differentiable SROCC variant by defining a pairwise preference label to approximate the non-smooth ranking function. Based on this, we develop a kind of global correlation consistency (GCC) loss by integrating evaluation metrics into the loss function, which enables direct optimization of IQA models for sequence correlation consistency. Besides, we introduce a queue mechanism to reuse previous data, ensuring that evaluation metrics computed on a batch of data closely approximates the results computed on the entire dataset. For architecture, inspired by mean opinion scores acquired through diverse human ratings, we present a mean-opinion network to aggregate various preference contexts, which are extracted from our meticulously designed multi-view attention learning modules, to a comprehensive quality score. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms SOTA methods on multiple authentic datasets with higher accuracy and better generalization. Moreover, the proposed GCC loss boosts the performance of existing IQA methods by replacing conventional distance-based losses. The code will be publicly available.
