    <summary><b>Quick Read (Click Me)</b></summary> This work addresses the problem of insufficient labeled data for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) with the help of pre-training techniques and external unsupervised data. We design a hierarchical curriculum learning (HCL) framework for NR-IQA, which leverages the external data to learn the prior knowledge about IQA widely and progressively. Specifically, as a closely-related task with NR-IQA, image restoration is used as the first curriculum to learn the image quality related knowledge (i.e., semantic and distortion information) on massive distorted-reference image pairs. Then multiple lightweight subnetworks are designed to learn human scoring rules on multiple available synthetic IQA datasets independently, and a cross-dataset quality assessment correlation (CQAC) module is proposed to fully explore the similarities and diversities of different scoring rules. Finally, the whole model is fine-tuned on the target authentic IQA dataset to fuse the learned knowledge and adapt to the target data distribution. The experimental results show that the designed pre-trained model can achieve good prediction accuracy and generalisation.
