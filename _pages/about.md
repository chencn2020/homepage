I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research interests include:
- Image Processing
- Image Signal Processing (ISP)
- Image Quality Assessment (IQA)
- Self-supervised Learning

|Publication Date|Paper Title|Conference / Journal|Summary|
|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |
|July 2023|Hierarchical Curriculum Learning for No-reference Image Quality Assessment|IJCV|We proposed a hierarchical curriculum learning IQA algorithm<br> We defined the image restoration task, the IQA task on a synthetic distortion dataset, and the IQA task on a real distortion dataset as a learning process from easy to difficult<br> Mimicking human learning behavior, we trained a level-wise IQA network from generalized to specialized.|
|September 2022|Teacher-Guided Learning for Blind Image Quality Assessment| ACCV 2023 | We pre-trained a teacher network using the image restoration task to learn semantic and distortion information strongly related to IQA<br> Then, this teacher network guided the student network to fine-tune on the target task<br> It achieved the state-of-the-art level at that time in single dataset, small sample experiments, and cross-dataset validation.|
